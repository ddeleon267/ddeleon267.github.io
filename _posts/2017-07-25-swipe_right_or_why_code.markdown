Allow me to use dating as an analogy here.

Most people don’t fall in love at first sight, or marry the first person they date and live happily ever after. 

Most people don’t “just know.” Some do, if you believe them, but for the rest of us there is some trial and error.  Something seems promising, you feel each other out, and you put in some work. There are generally some ups and downs-- more for some couples than for others. 

If things work out— great! If not, you pursue another option and try, try, again. The takeaway is that most people don’t get it right on the first try, and that’s fine. I imagine most developers would agree that this is true for coding as well.

For now, though, let’s entertain the idea that finding the right career is similar in many ways to dating.

# The Ex: 

For several years, I was a teacher. A middle school science teacher, a middle school math teacher, and then a high school physics teacher for a while after that. Although there was a bit of a learning curve, things went pretty well for a long time. 

Objectively, I was well-suited to a career as a teacher, and it was seemingly well-suited to me.  I was highly qualified, I was always a strong student, and I liked teaching others— my sister often tells me that she always knew I would be a teacher. I cared (and still care) about the work that I did. I appreciated it, I enjoyed many aspects of it, and by most accounts, I was pretty damn good at it.

Many people who have been in long-term relationships will tell you that, somewhere, deep inside, there is a part of you that hates your partner. Insert “resents,” if you prefer. This is true no matter how wonderful the relationship may be.  

There was a part of me that *hated* being a teacher. In all fairness, what I hated was that it took up most of my time and energy, not just during the school day but afterward. It was consuming my life. I would come home from work, just to rest briefly and then do… more work, for hours, until it was time to sleep. Teaching, tutoring, grading, planning, sleep. *Wash, rinse, repeat. *

While I cared about my students and I was pretty good at teaching overall, I started to resent putting out so much energy and time to get so little in return.  It went well for a while, but I could see that it wasn’t forever: I was over it.

# Single and Ready to Mingle:

I suppose the analogy breaks down a bit here. While #IDon’tNeedAMan, I certainly need to pay my rent and my student loans. I can’t say I’m the type to pull off being fashionably unemployed. 

Time to mingle!

I have a few friends who have done coding bootcamps, and one friend in particular has been nudging me to do the same whenever I’ve expressed my frustrations with “the Ex.”  I was still on the fence until about a year ago, and I decided to go for it. I’m intelligent and capable, and my friends were able to transition into coding jobs successfully despite having no background in the field, so I am confident that I will be able to do the same.  Worst case scenario, I don’t change careers, I spend some money, but I at least learn a skill that is becoming more and more useful— even necessary, in many careers. Best case, I’m great at coding, and I land a sweet job that offers me greater work-life balance and flexibility in what I do. 

# The one?

I suppose time will tell. At this point, my main motivation to pursue coding is because I don’t want to do some other things currently on the table for me. I don’t want to continue teaching, I don’t feel compelled to go to grad school to pursue a specific career or area of research, and I certainly don’t want to deeply into debt to pursue a degree simply for the sake of doing so. 

As I sometimes used to say to my students: this is not a “sexy” answer. Sometimes reality isn't sexy.

# Final thoughts

I think coding is useful, as I’m sure all of us here do. As a science teacher, I often stressed this to my students --while being “literate” used to just mean being able to read and write in the literal sense, that really doesn’t get people as far as it used to. Being able to code is becoming important in a wide range of careers. As I'm struggling through labs (I don't know about you, but I never want to play Tic-Tac-Toe again) I can appreciate that, even if I’m not a developer 10 or 20 years from now, I’ll at least have learned concrete skills that I can transfer to many different career paths. 

I also think I’ll be good at it. I like learning just to learn, and I tend to be good at things. I appreciate logic, I'm stubborn, and I’ve always learned languages pretty readily, so I’m sure those things will benefit me as I’m navigating different coding languages and their syntaxes. 

Why coding? I’ve thought about more romanticized answers to this question, but to be honest I’m just not there yet. I’m not especially drawn to coding philosophically or symbolically -- yet -- although I anticipate that will change over time. There’s no love at first sight here, and I’m cool with that. I'll still be feeling it out for a while, but I'm liking it so far, and I’m hopeful.
