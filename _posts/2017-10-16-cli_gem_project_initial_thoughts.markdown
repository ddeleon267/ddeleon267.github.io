How do you create something out of nothing? And where do you start?

I don't know that I consider myself much of a creative type, at least not more so than the average person . When I was younger I had my fair share of experiences flexing that particular muscle-- painting, writing, building. But I don't find myself bursting with “big” ideas too often, and I tend to give myself a hard time about it.

I once had a student tell me that math is her favorite subject in school because there is always a right answer, and she finds that comforting. While at the time I took it as rather amusing insight from a 12-year-old, I certainly get where she was coming from. Ambiguity is uncomfortable, and having a clear destination is comforting: when you've made it, you know. Even better if you have a path to follow, or a starting point, or... anything, really. Starting from nothing, or nearly nothing, is rough.

I've never read Vonnegut, but apparently he once said, "When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth." I would say that's an apt description of what I'm feeling whenever I'm creating: thrashing around inneffectually in an attempt to create something meaningful (mostly making a mess of things and tiring myself out in the process). If I'm lucky, though, a crude approximation of something meaningful might begin to stick out in the mess of whatever I have made.

Because of this, while I’ve always enjoyed writing (and would like to think that I’m at least decent at it) it is nearly always painful.

I had hoped that coding would be different, before I knew enough to know better. I mean, sometimes it is-- when you're working on most labs or on a simple problem, it seems pretty straight forward. If you know your goal, and you know a few rules about syntax and logic, solving the problem is relatively simple and immediately satisfying. You may get stuck, but there are logical cues and tools you can use to work your way through the problem. 

Of course problems aren’t always so simple, and the more interesting ones almost never are.
At the end of the day, you're still creating, and things get messy.

Which leads to to my first project, the Ruby Gem CLI Project.

Coming up with the idea was the simplest “hard” thing to get over.  The thought process is something like:&#x2028;&#x2028;1. No ideas 
2. Briefly berate myself for not having a list of brilliant ideas immediately
3. What can I not do? (There were a few ideas we were explicitly told not to use, so those were out)
4. What is something that would interest me? Something I find interesting would (in theory) keep me going as I struggled through the hard stuff. 

Well, what are my interests? The internet, makeup, youtube, craft beer, powerlifting. All of this pondering is a little stressful, so a beer sounds pretty good right about now.
